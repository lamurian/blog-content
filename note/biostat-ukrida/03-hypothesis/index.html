<h1>Research in A Nutshell</h1>
<p>Researchers ought to conduct a thorough and objective observation. In doing so,
we may start from formulating a question and hypothesis prior to making
prediction, performing experiments, and analyzing results. Hypotheses are
different from theory, where we need evidence to establish the fact revolving
around proposed hypotheses. A research or investigation is a mean to
substantiate evidence and support the hypothesis. Thus, hypothesis needs to
comply with cases and variables introduced in a study.</p>

</div>
<div id="cases-and-variables" class="section level1">
<h1>Cases and Variables</h1>
<p>When performing an investigation, we first need to state what cases and
variables to investigate. Cases are observable subjects, which apply to
anything in research settings, e.g. a patient in medical research, an atom in
physics, a substance in chemical engineering, and so on. There is no boundary
to define a subject in research, but they have similarities: they are
observable. It is important to notice that characteristics in observed cases
are our variables of interest, quantifiable as a discrete or continuous
measures. We shall proceed with a few example to distinguish cases and
variables.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ten schizophrenic patients participated in a study on brain activity. They
underwent computer-based tests on psychotic symptoms and fMRI examination to
observe the functional connectivity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In this example, we have schizophrenic patients as our observable subjects,
i.e. our cases. Then we measured reported psychotic symptoms and functional
connectivity as our variables of interest.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A group of botanists observed different species of molds under conditioned
environments. They set up different humidity levels and temperature to
observe cellular integrity.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The second example stated different species of molds as its respective cases,
where humidity levels, temperature, and cellular integrity are included
variables. What makes both examples different? The second example imply an
association between the former two variables and the latter one. It implicitly
indicates the possibility of cellular integration being influenced by
temperature and humidity levels. We observed no such an indication in the first
example. This brought us to distinguish a different type of variables, i.e.
independent and dependent.</p>
<p>Independent variables are those being unaffected by other variables. In experimental
setups, independent variables are directly under our control. Design-wise, it
is a <strong>presumed</strong> cause in our hypothesis. I wish to highlight the word
presumed as we are yet to establish the evidence and later we shall learn
that proving causality is not a trivial matter. As opposed to independent
ones, dependent variables are affected by other variables. When conducting an
experiments, we have dependent variables under our <em>indirect</em> control, so it is
a <strong>presumed</strong> effect.</p>
<div id="grouping" class="section level2">
<h2>Grouping</h2>
<p>Using a categorical independent variable, we can separate each observation into
their respective groups. By doing so, we can differentiate <em>within</em> and
<em>between</em> subjects. Within subject helps us examine the same subject overtime.
We usually use such a design when testing the subject multiple times, using a
temporal indicator of <span class="math inline">\(t_N: N \ni \{1, 2, ..., n\}\)</span>. We can apply a within
subject perspective when investigating the same subject using different
measures. On the other hand, between subject is the perspective we use when
comparing different subject, usually seen in a test on multiple groups. For
example, suppose we have a brain recording data from a group of individuals,
where we recorded <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> waves. We shall see both waves as
different measures and delineate such a difference by comparing their record on
the same subject (within subject differences). It makes much more sense than
comparing <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> wave from two completely different people.
However, we <strong>can</strong> compare recorded <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> wave among different participants,
enabling us to discern between subject differences.</p>
<p>So far, it sounds interesting and all, but why should we do that? Please be
advised that by doing so will enable inferential statistics. We can describe an
association between variables in observed cases and further demonstrate
statistical significance in supporting our hypotheses. If you found some of the
words confusing, no need to be wary, as we will carefully discuss such a matter
in latter sections. However, we <strong>need</strong> to be wary of the drawback in grouping
our cases as we have to identify potential confounding variables, reduce bias,
and minimize random error.</p>
</div>
<div id="confounding-variable" class="section level2">
<h2>Confounding Variable</h2>
<p>A confounding variable is any variable, be either numeric or categoric, which
may impede us from correctly interpret the presumed causality. Confounding
variables may establish a causal association with either independent or
dependent variables. As it complicates the proposed causality, it reduces
internal validity! Internally valid research will present a clear evidence,
hence confounding variables are ones to obfuscate such findings.</p>

<div id="cognitive-bias-in-research" class="section level2">
<h2>Cognitive Bias in Research</h2>
<p>The presence of a cognitive bias introduces partiality in conducted
investigation. Among a plethora of biases and fallacies, we shall take a look
at most common ones happening during research, including:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Selection bias</li>
<li>Information bias</li>
<li>Detection bias</li>
<li>Performance bias</li>
<li>Attrition bias</li>
<li>Reporting bias</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/0xKklLplngs/maxresdefault.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>Selection bias occurs when the proportion of selected subjects does not
represent the population, either as under- or over-coverage. Having
inappropriate proportions may obscure the actual differences in population.
Selection bias may happen out of participant’s volition or investigator’s
negligence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, information bias happens when acquired information do not
represent the truth. On participants’ side, information bias usually manifest
as recall or response bias, with recall bias being the inability to recall
correct information and response bias happened following a vaguely interpreted
question. Investigators are also prone to manifest a bias, either as
interviewer or confirmation bias. Interviewer bias occurs upon using
close-ended questions, where the interviewer may only look for answers
they want to observe. Confirmation bias is a tendency to only confirm responses
conforming their assumptions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, detection bias takes place when investigators only detect outcome in
a group with certain characteristics. Performance bias is an inclination to
give different treatment to favour a certain outcome. Attrition bias usually
happen in a longitudinal study, where subjects opt to drop out or not comply
with follow-up schedules. As a rule of thumb, having at most 20% lost to follow
up or drop out rate is still acceptable for most research. Reporting bias is a
tendency to only report significant findings and neglect insignificant ones.</p>
<p>After carefully identify potential biases, we may handle them through several
means:
- Random sampling
- Random assignment
- Blinding:
- Participant
- Investigator
- Mediating parties</p>
</div>
<div id="systematic-and-random-errors" class="section level2">
<h2>Systematic and Random Errors</h2>
<p>Both confounding variables and biases contribute to systematic errors, where we
have a hunch on how they will affect the data. They often have a mathematical
solution since they happen systematically, e.g. an offset and scale factor
error. However, a random error is a type of error we cannot completely handle.
It is unpredictable and unreplicable, also presents with no mathematical
solution. As the error happen randomly, we often call them an unsystematic
error or system noise. To adequately handle random errors, we may focus our
utmost efforts on increasing the sample size or taking the average measurement
value.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="formulating-a-hypothesis" class="section level1">
<h1>Formulating a Hypothesis</h1>
<p>We have hypotheses as assumptions about the population parameters, stated as
the null <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> and alternative <span class="math inline">\(H_a\)</span> hypothesis. In the null hypothesis, we
regard observed results as happening purely by chance. Contrarily, the
alternative hypothesis assumes observed results occurred due to some non-random
causes. As we only have a sampled data, we do not accept the alternative
hypothesis. Through a formal procedure, we can either reject or fail to reject
<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>.</p>
<p>In our last lecture, we flipped a coin ten times, which happened to have
following sequences:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>set.seed(1)
coin &lt;- sample(c(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;T&quot;), 10, replace=TRUE, prob=rep(1/2, 2)) %T&gt;% print()</code></pre>
<pre><code>##  [1] &quot;T&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;T&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;H&quot; &quot;T&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Now, we will formulate hypotheses on our coin flip and determine
whether or not to reject the <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(H_0:\)</span> The probability of having the head is <span class="math inline">\(P = 0.5\)</span><br />
<span class="math inline">\(H_a:\)</span> The probability of having the head is <span class="math inline">\(P \neq 0.5\)</span></p>
<div id="formal-test" class="section level2">
<h2>Formal Test</h2>
<p>coineeing the proportion being 0.6, can we reject the
<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>? Well, not quite ;) Rejecting a hypothesis requires a formal proof using
statistical tests. For now, we are quite comfortable in conducting goodness of
fit test. We previously agreed our coin flip follows a Bernoulli trial and
binomial distribution. So, we will test our hypotheses using a binomial test.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>binom.test(x={sum(coin==&quot;H&quot;)}, n=length(coin), p=0.5)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 
##  Exact binomial test
## 
## data:  {     sum(coin == &quot;H&quot;) } and length(coin)
## number of successes = 6, number of trials = 10, p-value = 0.8
## alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is not equal to 0.5
## 95 percent confidence interval:
##  0.262 0.878
## sample estimates:
## probability of success 
##                    0.6</code></pre>
<p>Seeing the p-value &gt; 0.05, we can formally state the failure on rejecting
<span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. The following figure represent other examples on null hypothesis:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/ecEpNtO4nzukTc7bnwZMHhEfwjQ=/1500x1000/filters:fill(auto,1)/null-hypothesis-examples-609097_FINAL-100262e70b70426fb0633304eb2f49f4.png" width="100%"></p>
<p>As previously demonstrated, a formal test looks for the correspondence between
our data and the <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. When the sampled data are consistent with <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>, we are
bound to fail in rejecting the <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. In otherwise cases, we can confidently
reject <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. Please note that there are three types of formal test in general:</p>
<ul>
<li>Two-tailed: <span class="math inline">\(H_0 \neq H_a\)</span></li>
<li>Right-tailed: <span class="math inline">\(H_0 &gt; H_a\)</span></li>
<li>Left-tailed: <span class="math inline">\(H_0 &lt; H_a\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>We can reject our <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> based on either one of two available criteria. The
first procedure will have us observe the critical value within a region of
acceptance, often used in older statistical method. For a more sophisticated
approach, we may choose to use p-value and confidence interval. From this
lecture onwards, we shall regard statistical significance as a p-value lower
than a certain threshold.</p>
</div>
<div id="interpreting-hypotheses" class="section level2">
<h2>Interpreting Hypotheses</h2>
<p>When testing the hypothesis, we start from the initial assumption of <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>
being true. We need collected evidence to show otherwise before we can reject
the <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. We can either reject or fail to reject the <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> based on the
p-value computed by statistical tests we employed. However, statistical error
may arise when testing the hypothesis. Immediate recognition of both errors
will help us in correctly interpreting our results:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type I: False Reject Rate <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \to\)</span> false positive</li>
<li>Type II: False Accept Rate <span class="math inline">\(\beta \to\)</span> false negative</li>
</ul>
<p>It may sound confusing at first, but we can imagine it more intuitively:</p>
<ul>
<li>Type I error happens when we state <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> as true, while it is actually wrong</li>
<li>Type II error happens when we state <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span> as wrong, while it is actually true</li>
</ul>
<p>Following figure may provide a better explanation on the concept :)</p>
<p><img src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-wmZzvsY_Tec/Vws0f4MJn9I/AAAAAAAAORs/gipKxA7aDboP0gx2vSmyQS_ZoVBPzqaWA/s1600/Type%2BI%2Band%2BII%2Berror.jpg" width="100%"></p>
<p>Then, what about <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>? The false reject rate <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is the
probability of rejecting a correct <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. We use <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> as our level of
significance, <em>viz.</em> a cut-off to determine statistically significant p-value.
We can use any value as our <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, be it .1, .05, .01, and so on. However,
we conveniently assign .05 as our common cut-off. In interpreting the p-value &lt;
.05, we can say it out loud as:</p>
<p>“We have a 5% chance of falsely rejecting the null hypothesis, thus we can
confidently regard our findings as significant.”</p>
<p>As we shall see, the higher our <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is, the higher our probability on
false rejecting <span class="math inline">\(H_0\)</span>. Thus, we aim to have the lowest possible p-value when
interpreting our results by assigning <span class="math inline">\(\alpha \leqslant 0.1\)</span>.</p>

<h1>Study Designs</h1>
<p>Each field of science contribute to developing appropriate study designs to
support their investigations, resulting in a plethora of available designs to
use! This post will only focus on several of the most common ones in biomedical
research. Please be advised that we purposely exclude case report and case
series from this post. Although both are important designs widely used in
biomedical research, we cannot completely implement statistical measures in
such designs. Instead, we will briefly introduce systematic review and
meta-analysis, where excluded designs are applicable to use in any of both.

with a particular study design.</p>
