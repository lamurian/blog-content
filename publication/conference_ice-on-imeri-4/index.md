summary: Indonesia has experienced an increasing surge of published scientific articles in recent years. In medical science, published articles greatly vary from both pre-clinical and clinical studies, where each study possesses a different methodological approach and hypothetical premise. However, some articles do not include rigorous documentation to make it reproducible. Moreover, the lack of centralized database further impedes researcher from reanalysing previous findings and integrating them with the new study. This paper delineates such an issue by constructing a graph database to centralize and integrate clinical research data. The database is constructed using Neo4j and cypher querying language and populated with 5,000 medical records generated by the synthea program. We address the viabilities of our proposed data curation method by simulating data of different sizes. Our database was able to answer queries requiring complex relationships while minimizing the amount of database hits. We conclude that graph databases are quite performant for solving data integration and centralization issues faced by life science research institutes.
