abstract: Hypertension is the second most prevalent disease in Pasar Rebo Community Health Center based on the annual reports in 2015, and 86.05% of hypertension patients is uncontrolled. Community diagnosis was conducted to determine diet and physical activity habits in patients with uncontrolled hypertension, investigating the factors that influence treatment outcome in the population. The design used in this study is mixed methods, viz. collecting and analyzing quantitative data followed by further discussion on qualitative data. Primary data was collected in Puskesmas Kecamatan Pasar Rebo through questionnaires and in-depth interviews. In general, diet and physical activity habits in both groups do not differ greatly, but in the group of patients with uncontrolled hypertension, salt intake, vegetables and fruits consumption, as well as physical activity are notably worse. In the study subjects, this is caused by a lack of effective patient education by health service providers and low motivation in the patients to be physically active. To improve treatment in hypertensive patients, patient education methods need to be improved and tailored to patients’ needs. Health service providers need to consider individual factors such as social and environmental factors and give recommendations accordingly.
